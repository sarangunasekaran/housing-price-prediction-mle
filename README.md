The story is based on a group of graduate students and professors who are working together to solve the issue of predicting the median house values in Californian districts. They find that they cannot confidently predict this number because they don't have enough resources to confirm their answers.

The main character, John, is a graduate student who has some ideas about how to find additional data. He wants to go off on his own and figure out how he can gather data for the project.

John gathers data from various sources, including Zillow which led him to discover that there are ways people from outside California can buy homes in California. This gave him an idea for generating more data points by purchasing homes in other areas with similar attributes and make predictions about median house values in Californian districts.

John decided to purchase a home in California and when he does, he discovers that it's more difficult than anticipated because he needs a cosigner who is living here. So, he approaches his friend, a data scientist. He helps his friend to predict median house values in Californian districts, given many features from these districts. The data scientist has been working on this project for months and has made little progress. 

One day, he comes across an article about a new machine-learning technique that can predict the median house value of an area with more accuracy than the current model. Excited, the data scientist applies this technique to his own dataset and finds that it works better than his previous model.

In the end, the data scientist uses this new technique to predict median house values in Californian districts with more accuracy than before.

Note: The idea of narrating the project in a storyplot is to quickly identify the importance of the project and it will be helpful to remember.
